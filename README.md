A code to solve the superconducting FLEX approximation.
## Please Note
Due to a change in funding, this project had to be put on hold while it was still in a prelimnary stage.
Tests show that the convergence of simple cosine band models was not recovering literature completely. More tests are needed.
## Prerequisites
This package needs BLAS/LAPACK implemented via MKL or Atlas, an MPI implementation and fftw3.

## Installing
This project has a make file, please edit it to link to the correct libaries.
It is part of the TODO's of this project to provide a more convinient method of installation.

## Running the tests
